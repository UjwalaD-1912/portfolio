# Profile Photo Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Save Your Profile Photo

1. **Save the attached image** to your project folder:
   - Right-click on the image you provided
   - Save it as: `profile-photo.jpg`
   - Location: `/Users/ujwaladindi/Desktop/Ujwala Project/images/profile-photo.jpg`

2. **Alternative method** (if drag and drop doesn't work):
   - Take a screenshot of the image you provided
   - Crop it to focus on your face and upper body
   - Save as `profile-photo.jpg` in the `images` folder

## Step 2: Optimize the Image (Optional but Recommended)

For best results, your profile photo should be:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels (square)
- **File size**: Less than 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality**: High resolution but web-optimized

### Free Online Tools to Resize/Optimize:
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - For compression
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - For resizing and cropping
- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - Free online Photoshop alternative

## Step 3: Verify the Image Path

After saving the image, your folder structure should look like:
```
Ujwala Project/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── images/
│   └── profile-photo.jpg  ← Your photo here
├── README.md
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

## Step 4: Test the Website

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Your professional photo should now appear in the hero section
3. The image should be circular with a nice border and hover effect

## Troubleshooting

**If the image doesn't show:**
1. Check the file name is exactly: `profile-photo.jpg`
2. Make sure it's in the `images` folder
3. Try refreshing the browser (Cmd+R on Mac)
4. Check browser developer tools for any error messages

**If you need a different image format:**
- You can use `.png` instead of `.jpg`
- Just update the filename in the HTML: change `profile-photo.jpg` to `profile-photo.png`

Your professional photo from the attachment (sitting in the beautiful wicker chair with flowers) will look perfect in the hero section of your Salesforce portfolio!
